## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted slate blue (#3D5566) reflecting contemplation and professionalism, suitable for headings and prominent UI elements.
- Background color: A very light, almost off-white with a hint of blue (#ECF0F1), providing a clean, spacious canvas for journal entries.
- Accent color: A deep violet (#6148E0) for interactive elements and highlights, conveying creativity and depth without being overly vibrant.
- Headline and body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), chosen for its modern clarity and excellent readability across different screen sizes, supporting a straightforward and clean aesthetic.
- Use minimalist line icons, particularly for navigation and interactive elements, to maintain a clean and unobtrusive design.
- A clean, single-column layout for journal entries with generous whitespace, ensuring focus on content. The homepage will feature the profile prominently at the top, followed by the journal listing.
- Subtle, non-distracting animations for link hovers or page transitions to enhance user interaction without overwhelming the 'static site' feel.
